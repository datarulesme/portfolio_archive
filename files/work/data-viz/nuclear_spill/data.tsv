#EEC535	Chalk River Incident	The Chalk River Incident, a level 5 event occurred on	Dec. 12	5	1952	0	Few people were exposed to high levels of radiation, according to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. 	An explosion destroyed the reactor’s core, releasing radioactive material. 
#EEC536	Kyshtym, Russia	This level 6 event in Kyshtym, Russia occurred on	Sept. 29	6	1957	0	Possible contamination of 500 miles. Health effects uncertain. The accident was allegedly kept secret by the Soviet government. 	An explosion made this the third largest nuclear accident in history. 
#EEC537	Windscale Fire, UK	This level 5 event in Windscale Fire, UK occurred on	Oct. 10	5	1957	0.1	Estimated to have caused more than 200 cases of cancer. Recent studies suggest a higher number. 	Largest nuclear accident in Great Britain’s history. Radioactive material spread through Europe and Scandinavia after a facility fire. 
#D8472A	Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Sodium Reactor Experiment	The Santa Susana Field Laboratory/Sodium Reactor Experiment's level is unknown but documentation indicates that it was 260 times worse than the Three Mile Island Disaster.  This incident occurred on	 July 13	3	1959	0	 Could have caused 1,800 cases of cancer. People living within two miles of Santa Susana had a 60 percent greater chance of getting certain types of cancers, according to a 2007 study.	Partial nuclear meltdown at the facility’s Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE). It’s unknown how much radiation was released because records were destroyed or lost. Some consider it the “worst nuclear accident” in U.S. history. It might have released up to 260 times more radiation than the disaster at Three Mile Island. 
#EEC537	SL-1 Incident 	The SL-1 Incident, a level 4 event occurred on	Jan. 3	4	1961	0	Contamination released was considered minimal. Some studies say about 790 people were exposed to radiation during clean-up. 	A U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor exploded and killed three operators. First fatal nuclear reactor accident in the U.S. 
#EEC538	Three Mile Island Disaster	The Three Mile Island Disaster, a level 5 event occurred on	42091	5	1979	0	About 2 million people received a relatively small dose of radiation exposure, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 	This partial nuclear meltdown was considered the worst nuclear accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history. 
#D8472A	Yucca Flat Incident	The Yucca Flat Incident's level in unknown. This event occurred on	Dec. 18	3	1980	0	About 86 workers were exposed to radioactive material.  	Radioactive material spread when a seal broke during an underground bomb test. 
#EEC537	Buenos Aires Accident	The Buenos Aires Accident, a level 4 event occurred on	Sept. 23	4	1983	0	One operator died soon after the incident and about 17 others received high doses of radiation. 	Classified as a Level 4 event. 
#EEC538	Chernobyl Disaster 	The Chernobyl Disaster, a level 7 event occurred on	42120	7	1986	0	About 30 workers and firefighters died within a few months. Over 1 million people were possibly exposed to radiation, according to the World Nuclear Association. A 2006 report by the UN Chernobyl Forum’s ‘Health’ expert points to an increase of thyroid cancer related to the accident.  	Large quantities of radioactive material were released for about 10 days. Considered the worst nuclear power accident recorded in history. 
#EEC539	Goiania Accident, Brazil	The Goiania Accident, a level 5 event occurred on	Sept. 13	5	1987	0	Four people were killed and about 249 people were found with high levels of radiation exposure, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.	An abandoned radioactive medical teletherapy source was stolen and sold to a junkyard, exposing many people to radiation for about five days. 
#EEC540	Tokaimura Accident	The Tokaimura Accident, a level 4 event occurred on 	Sept. 13	4	1999	0	Two workers died and 119 were exposed to high levels of radiation, according to the World Nuclear Association. Only three were exposed to levels above permissible limits. 	This accident was the second to occur in Tokaimura. 
#EEC541	Fukushima Daiichi Accident	The Fukushima Daiichi Accident, a level 7 event occurred on	11-Mar	7	2011	0	No deaths from radiation exposure have been linked to the accident, according to the World Nuclear Association. Female infants living in the most contaminated areas have a 70 percent higher risk of developing thyroid cancer, according to a 2013 World Health Organization report.	After a 9.0 magnitude earthquake sent a tsunami into the Fukushima Daiichi facility received radioactive material was released for four to six days, contaminating about 11,580 square miles.
